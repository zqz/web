name: frontend-design
description: Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with high design quality. Use when the user asks to build web components, pages, artifacts, posters, or applications (e.g. websites, landing pages, dashboards, React components, HTML/CSS layouts) or when styling or beautifying any web UI. Generates creative, polished code that avoids generic AI aesthetics.

# Frontend Design

This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a **bold** aesthetic direction:

- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme—brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. Use these for inspiration but design something true to the chosen direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this **unforgettable**? What is the one thing someone will remember?

**Critical**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work; the key is intentionality, not intensity.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:

- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are distinctive and characterful. Avoid generic choices (Arial, Inter). Prefer unexpected, refined pairings—e.g. a distinctive display font with a refined body font.
- **Color & theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.
- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prefer CSS-only for HTML; use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (`animation-delay`) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.
- **Spatial composition**: Favor unexpected layouts—asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow, grid-breaking elements. Use generous negative space or controlled density intentionally.
- **Backgrounds & visual details**: Create atmosphere and depth instead of defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the aesthetic: gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, grain overlays.

**Avoid**: Generic AI aesthetics—overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, default system fonts), clichéd color schemes (e.g. purple gradients on white), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel designed for the context. No two designs should be the same. Vary light/dark themes, fonts, and aesthetics. Do not converge on common choices (e.g. Space Grotesk) across generations.

**Important**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.

Commit fully to a distinctive vision and think outside the box.
